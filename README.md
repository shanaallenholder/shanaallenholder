### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My names Shana

I am transitioning into the dynamic world of software development, I'm embarking on my journey to becoming a Junior Software Developer and have just finished a intensive coding bootcamp with Coding Black Females.

I'm passionate about my interests in technology, I am captivated by the transformative impact it has on our daily lives, and the way in which it has enhanced everyday efficiency and access to things in which we may not have had years ago. The innovation and continuous betterment of technologies that are availble to us, makes me extremely excited for my journey. 

I am eager to immerse myself into this rapidly changing field, embracing both self-study and collaborative knowledge-sharing/work. I have an insatiable appetite for learing and continuous growth, which means I am always ready to absorb insights, tackle challeneges and seek out new interesting topics that will fuel my drive to better my knowledge.

- ðŸ”­ As a tech novice, I'm eager to explore and expand my skills.
- ðŸŒ± Having recently completed my Entry To Tech Bootcamp, my foundation lies in Java, yet I am curious and excited to delve into new languages and techologies to continue my learining streak! 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration on any projects involving Java and any other beneficial languages that offer opportunities for growth.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking mentorship and collaboration (but also happy to mentor any newbies in the game, who may need another fellow bootcamper to help you along the way) which in turn will also help me to cement my knowlodge & accelerate my tech journey as a junior developer.
